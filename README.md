# Google_Fiber_BI_Project
Google Fiber, a company which provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet. The Fiber customer service team has asked to design a dashboard using fictional data. Customer call center at Google Fiber uses business intelligence to monitor and improve customer satisfaction.
The team needs to understand how often customers  phone customer support again after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand whether the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. Further, leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers are having to call more than once, as well as how to improve the overall customer experience. I will create a dashboard to reveal insights about repeat callers. 

This fictional dataset is a version of actual data the team works with. Because of this, the data is already anonymized and approved. It includes: Number of calls, Number of repeat calls after first contact, Call type, Market city, Date.

Project goal: Explore trends in repeat callers.

The teamâ€™s ultimate goal is to reduce call volume by increasing customer satisfaction and improving operational optimization. My dashboard should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent.
